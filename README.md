## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title



To make this website more assessable with standards, I changed some div tags to the semantic HTML elements, also I put logical order. 

At the same time I  did some changes such as adding alt attributes into img links, changing title, and ordering h tags.

I simplified CSS file , by using classes and remove repeating.
